    <h2>üå∏ Hey, you beautiful soul! Welcome to my little corner of the internet!!!</h2>
    <p>
I‚Äôm Sandhiya ‚Äî a curious wanderer in the world of code and chaos, born under Karur‚Äôs quiet skies, raised with dreams louder than thunder.

I don‚Äôt just chase goals‚Ä¶ I question why they matter. Engineer by day, starry-eyed thinker by night, I sip on thoughts like warm coffee ‚Äî strong, deep, sometimes a little sweet.

Words are my playground, logic is my toolkit, and in between, I live for those little sparks ‚Äî a sunset, a shared smile, a bug finally fixed.

I‚Äôve stumbled, stuttered, stood back up, with 92% on my 12th board and a heart that scores even higher in hope. From classrooms to coding labs, from stage fright to bold mics, I‚Äôm learning to be loud ‚Äî not in volume, but in value.

Short-term? A desk in an MNC.
Long-term? A passport full of stamps and two parents smiling beside me.

So if you‚Äôre into heartbeats, hashtags, and human moments ‚Äî stick around. We‚Äôve got stories to tell, and maybe, just maybe, you‚Äôll find a bit of you in me.

    <h2>üìö A Little Trail Through My Learning Days</h2>
    <p>
School was never just about marks for me ‚Äî it was where curiosity quietly bloomed.

I studied at Sowdambikaa Group of Schools, where the days were filled with chalkboard scribbles, lunchbox laughter, and dreams tucked inside notebooks.

I scored 92% in 12th grade, but more than the numbers, it was the thrill of learning that stayed with me. Among all the subjects, Physics had a gentle way of making me wonder ‚Äî not just how things worked, but why.

Now, I‚Äôm in my second year of Computer Science Engineering at M. Kumarasamy College of Engineering, where learning feels like building my own little future ‚Äî one line of code, one solved bug, one step closer to the life I imagine.

It‚Äôs not always easy ‚Äî but with a curious heart and a stubborn mind, I‚Äôm making it mine, day by day.

    <h2>üìö Chapters That Shaped Me</h2>
    <p>
Books have always been my quiet friends ‚Äî soft-spoken, deep, and full of surprises.

I‚Äôve wandered through Kalki‚Äôs Ponniyin Selvan, got lost in the emotion of "The Alchemist", and felt the calm truth in "Atomic Habits".

Each story left a mark ‚Äî some taught me to dream, others, to stay grounded.

I may not read fast, but I read with feeling. And every good book? It becomes a part of who I am.

    <h2>üç∞ Things I Do for the Soul</h2>
    <p>
When life gets loud, I find peace in quiet things.

I love cooking and baking ‚Äî not just for the taste, but for the calm it brings. There‚Äôs something magical about turning simple ingredients into something warm, comforting, and made with love.

I spend time reading, losing myself in other people‚Äôs worlds, and then return to mine ‚Äî where I write down random thoughts, messy, honest, and straight from the heart.

These aren‚Äôt just hobbies. They‚Äôre little rituals that make me feel more me.

    <h2>üìù My Heart‚Äôs Bucket List</h2>
    <p>
I dream of becoming an independent woman ‚Äî one who faces challenges with courage and calm.

I want to take my parents abroad, watch their eyes light up in places they've only seen in pictures. That moment? It'll mean more than any medal.

Helping people who struggle ‚Äî financially or emotionally ‚Äî has always been close to my heart. Not for attention, but for the quiet joy it brings.

And above all, I just want a life that feels genuinely mine ‚Äî strong, kind, and full of purpose.

    <h2>What is this blog about?</h2>
    <p>
Hey, I‚Äôm Sandhiya ‚Äî a curious soul from Karur, walking the path of a Computer Science student with a heart full of dreams.

I find joy in reading, baking, cooking, and writing down thoughts that don‚Äôt always make sense but always feel true.

I believe in quiet strength, simple living, and standing tall through any storm. My biggest dream? To become an independent woman and take my parents abroad one day.

I‚Äôve always wanted to help people rise ‚Äî not for praise, but for peace.

Books shaped my thoughts, code shapes my future, and kindness shapes my soul.

This blog is a little piece of me ‚Äî honest, warm, and always growing. Thanks for being here. Let‚Äôs unfold the chapters together. üí´
‚Äî With love,¬†<a href="#social">Sandhiya¬†‚ù§</a>
